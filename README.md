## 🚀 The Project
**EcoSentinel** is a web application designed to promote **Climate Action (SDG 13)** through technology. It connects users to real-time weather data, issues critical alerts for extreme conditions (heatwaves, storms), and gamifies the donation process to support environmental causes.

**Key Value Proposition:**
Unlike standard weather apps, EcoSentinel contextualizes weather data into *actionable sustainability advice* and drives engagement through a leaderboard system linked to real donations.

## ⚙️ Key Features
* **📡 Real-Time Monitoring:** Integration with **OpenWeatherMap API** (One Call 3.0) for precision forecasting.
* **🚨 Smart Alerts:** Logic that detects anomalies (e.g., Temperature > 30°C or Heavy Rain) and triggers educational alerts.
* **💸 Payment Integration:** Seamless donation flow using **Mercado Pago API** (Checkout Pro).
* **🏆 Gamification:** LocalStorage-based ranking system where financial support translates into "Resilience Points".
* **🎨 Responsive UI:** Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, glassmorphism-inspired interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Modules).
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (CDN).
* **APIs:**
    * `OpenWeatherMap` (Weather Data & Geocoding).
    * `Mercado Pago` (Payment Preferences).
* **Persistence:** Browser LocalStorage (for user session and gamification data).
